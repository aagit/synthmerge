# Specification: Git Conflict Solutions Marker (`&` Sequence)

## 1. Overview
The `&` sequence (typically `&&&&&&&`) is an extension to the standard Git `diff3` conflict format introduced by `synthmerge`. It designates the start of **AI-generated solution sections** inserted between the standard remote code section (`=======`) and the closing conflict marker (`>>>>>>>`).

Its purpose is to present multiple distinct resolution attempts generated by different AI models or variants within a single conflict block. This allows users to review, compare, and select the optimal solution directly in their editor or via integrated tools like `smerge-mode`.

Each solution might be prefixed with attribution metadata indicating the source model and, where available, confidence metrics.

## 2. Visual Structure
A conflict block containing AI solutions follows this specific hierarchy:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
(Local/Current Branch Code)
||||||| BASE
(Ancestor/Original Code)
=======
(Remote/Incoming Branch Code)
&&&&&&& synthmerge: Model A (high effort) 12.5%
(Solution 1 generated by Model A)
&&&&&&& synthmerge: Model B (low effort) 8.2%
(Solution 2 generated by Model B)
&&&&&&& synthmerge: Model C, Model D 15.1%
(Solution 3 generated by Model C and Model D)
>>>>>>> REMOTE
```

## 3. Marker Size
The marker size (number of `&` characters) matches the length of the other conflict markers (`<`, `|`, `=`, `>`) in the current conflict block. It adheres to the `conflict-marker-size` gitattribute setting for the respective file.

## 4. Character Choice
The ampersand (`&`) was selected as the marker character after an evaluation of all suitable, readable, and non-conflicting candidates. The decision was driven by the need to minimize the probability of the marker appearing naturally in source code, which would cause false positives or parsing errors.

Through analysis of code in a variety of programming languages as well as documents, the sequence `^&+` was found to be the most unique in its statistical profile.
